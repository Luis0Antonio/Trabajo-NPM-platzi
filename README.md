# Say Hi

## Just a nice greeting


This repo just say Hi in different languages because It's important to be nice when you are new.

Actually It's builded because I'm learning to publish repos in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) ... It's also my [Platzi](https://platzi.com) homework.


## Install

```
npm install say-hi
```

## Usage

```
import say-hi from 'say-hi'

greeting("es") // Hola!
greeting("en") // Hello!
greeting("ger") // Hallo!
greeting("fre") // Salut!

```
